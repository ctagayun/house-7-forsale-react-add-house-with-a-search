/*
  React Controlled Components Task:
    - we modified the Search component. We added the value attribute
      
    <div className="float-start ">
            <label htmlFor="search">Search:</label>
            <input id="search" 
              value={props.search} <-- We added the value attribute
              type="text"
              onChange={props.onSearch}/> 
            <p> 
              Searching for <strong>{props.search}</strong>
            </p>
        </div>
    
    Here we added a "value" attribute instead of giving the 
    html element the freedom of keeping track of its internal state.
    Instead React uses state by leveraging the "value" attribute.
    Whenever the HTML search ox element emits change event the NEW VALUE 
    is WRITTEN to React states and RE-RENDERS the component. Then
    the HTML element uses the recent state as value again.
    
    - As a result because of the "value" attribute the input textbox 
      became EXPLICITLY controlled element and Search component became 
      IMPLICITLY a controlled component.

    Interview Questions:
      Question 1: What is a controlled component in React?
        Answer: A controlled component is a component whose 
               FORM elements are controlled by React state. 
                 
      Question 2: How do you create a controlled input in React?
       Answer: Set the input VALUE attribute to a state variable 
       and provide an onChange handler to update the state.

      Question 3: What is the role of the value prop in a controlled input element?
       Answer: The value prop sets the current value of the input, 
       making it a controlled component.

      Question 4: How do you handle a controlled checkbox in React?
         Answer: Use the checked attribute and provide an 
         onChange handler to update the corresponding state.

      Question 5: How do you clear the value of a controlled component?
        Answer: Set the state variable to an empty or null value to 
        clear the value of a controlled component.

      Question 6 : What are the potential downsides of using controlled 
      components?
        Answer: Controlled components can lead to verbose code, 
        especially in forms with many input elements. 
  ===============================================================     
  Previous Tasks:
    - create a search component
    - add code to display only the houses based on the search
      result.
    - add instantiation of Search component in App.jsx

  ===============================================================     
  Previous Task:
     - Create HouseList component
     - see discussion about React state in HouseList component.
     
  ===============================================================     

  Previous Task:
  Setup: 
    npm install bootstrap
    Once the installation is complete, we can include it in our appâ€™s 
    entry file in main.jsx :
    --  Bootstrap CSS
    import "bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css";
    -- Bootstrap Bundle JS
    import "bootstrap/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min";

    Now since we created the project with Vite, we can rely 
    on Vite's plugins to integrate ESLint properly. Run the 
    following command
       npm install vite-plugin-eslint --save-dev

   This is the callback handler for the Search component.

   whenever the user types something in the Search component. 
   For example when you type Tochi in the search input field 
   the target.value "Tochi" is passed to this callback handler.
     The handler then calls the state updater setSearchTerm()
